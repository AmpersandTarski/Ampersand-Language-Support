# Ampersand-Language-Support

Here is (a first attempt to) syntax coloring support for the Ampersand Definition Language (ADL).

You should either include (a symbolic link to) the 'ampersand' directory from this repo into the (target)directory `.vscode\extensions`. This target directory can be found in your personal directory, e.g. as `C:\Users\yourname\.vscode\extensions`. Then, you (re)start VSCode.

In order to see the colors, you should select the `ampersand`-theme as your theme in the editor.
