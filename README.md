# Ampersand-Language-Support

This extension provides langauge support for the [Ampersand](http://ampersandtarski.github.io/) Definition Language [(ADL)](https://ampersandtarski.gitbook.io/documentation). This is a language that allows one to define an application in terms of state (expressed in terms of concepts, relations and relation algebraic invariant rules), and interfaces that allow for state changes. The [tooling](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand) takes an ADL-script, and generates a complete web-application.

## Features

- syntax coloring grammar
- syntax coloring theme (ampersand)
- snippets that help you write the common language constructs

## Requirements

* In order to use the ampersand commands, it is required that you have [the ampersand executable](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand/releases/latest) in your path. The default build task is now set to check the current script.

## Extension Settings

* `ampersand.enable`: enable/disable this extension

## Known Issues

Features are currently testable, and may contain bugs. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand-Language-Support/issues) if you find a mistake.
