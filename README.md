# Ampersand-Language-Support

This extension provides langauge support for the [Ampersand](http://ampersandtarski.github.io/) Definition Language [(ADL)](https://ampersandtarski.gitbook.io/documentation). This is a language that allows one to define an application in terms of state (expressed in terms of concepts, relations and relation algebraic invariant rules), and interfaces that allow for state changes. The [tooling](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand) takes an ADL-script, and generates a complete web-application.
